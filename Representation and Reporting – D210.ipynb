The variables in the additional dataset help provide insights into the overall data trends because the extra data sets provide more data from different sources that can be combined and compared with the original data to provide more insights from more than one source of data. The more sources of data we have,the more likely the reports will be more correct and less chance of errors from one specific source."

These data representations show the vast majority of customers who churn are on the month-to-month contract. An executive could use this information to try and focus resources on getting customers to switch to other contract plans besides the monthly contract. Getting customers to switch off that contract type would vastly reduce the expected churn rate."

From start to finish, the whole report is about customer churn, starting with overall churn, and then churn compared with other variables. This engages an audience becuase they can see why and when customers churned and what correlated with that churn. The other element is the decor, in this case, the different visualizations of all the data. There are many different charts, graphs, maps, and colors. This engages an audience because it presents the data in a fun and engaging way, that is enjoyable to look at."
